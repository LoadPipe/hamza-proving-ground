# Hamza Proving Ground


A proving/testing ground for web3 R&D. 

--------------------------


### 1. Tokenomics 
- Speculative token vs. Redemption token: we can do both, and the speculative token should be burnable 
- Redemption token should be primary & subject of first effort 
- Both will be featured in the whitepaper 

**Redemptive (gold):**
- gives right to redeem a proportion (which increases over a vesting period up to 100%) of the treasury
- can be burned for a proportion of treasury
- can be purchased or awarded 
- can serve as seller stake
- gives governance votes 

**Speculative (gas):**
- gives no right to redeem anything
- can be burned on usage/actions in the ecosystem 
- can be purchased or awarded 
- can serve as seller stake
- may or may not give governance votes 


### 2. Web3 Issues 
**Account Abstracted Wallet**
- requires R&D 
- gasless transactions 
- one-click buy 
- account locking & recovery 
- account permissions 
- integration with credit cards 

**Orders**
- requires R&D 
- address privacy (can be done in short term) 
- what-you-ordered privacy (ZK) 
-- verify that user bought a thing, for the purpose of reviews
-- verify that a user bought from a set of things, for the purpose of legal compliance
