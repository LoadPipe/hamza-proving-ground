# Hamza Proving Ground


A proving/testing ground for web3 R&D. 

--------------------------


### 1. Tokenomics 
- Speculative token vs. Redemption token: we can do both, and the speculative token should be burnable 
- Redemption token should be primary & subject of first effort 
- Both will be featured in the whitepaper 

**Redemptive (gold):**
- gives right to redeem a proportion (which increases over a vesting period up to 100%) of the treasury
- can be burned for a proportion of treasury
- can be purchased or awarded 
- can serve as seller stake
- gives governance votes 

**Speculative (gas):**
- gives no right to redeem anything
- can be burned on usage/actions in the ecosystem 
- can be purchased or awarded 
- can serve as seller stake
- may or may not give governance votes

### 2. Web3 Issues 
**Account Abstracted Wallet**
- requires R&D 
- gasless transactions 
- one-click buy 
- account locking & recovery 
- account permissions 
- integration with credit cards 

**Orders**
- requires R&D 
- address privacy (can be done in short term) 
- what-you-ordered privacy (ZK) 
-- verify that user bought a thing, for the purpose of reviews
-- verify that a user bought from a set of things, for the purpose of legal compliance 

**Products**
- requires R&D 
- Mass Market?

**Yield Generation**
- requires R&D 
- breadchain?

**Choice of Chains**
- requires R&D 


### 3. Governance Structure 

Just an example, of a hybrid structure that incorporates both hats and governance votes granted by token:

While we agreed in principle, things to be fleshed out: 
- actual physical structure (above is just an example)
- specifics about the hybrid interaction of governance votes and hats


### 4. Whitepaper

- We agreed that the first efforts in web3 should be to support the whitepaper
  - The whitepaper will be a jumping off point for more concrete web3 development
  - The whitepaper has value in itself for the purpose of communicating to investors and collaborators
